Enter any username and click on the `Lobby` link - you may need to wait a few seconds for this to appear as the server will still go into sleep mode. Next challenge another player to a game by clicking the action in the list of players on the right. The other player could just be another tab on the same computer for testing, or anyone else visiting the same page. Once both players have joined the game (click the room name with the two player's names in the left hand list to join), you can start making moves.

The invited player will be The Phrygians, which is basically white, and the inviter will be The Hittites, or black. Moves will be shown in the other player's browser as they are entered. Possible moves will be highlighted when you click on a piece. Please wait for both players to enter the room before white moves a piece.
